Formalist
=========
Formalist is a jQuery plugin to perform **conditional web forms**. Thanks to the use of the HTML5 `data-` attribute, the plugin easily recognized elements to be displayed or hidden conditionally in your form. For example, when a checkbox is checked or a radio button is selected, Formalist will automatically performs the corresponding actions by masking or displaying the elements in cascade.

Compatibility
-------------
Formalist is fully tested on **Google Chrome** for desktop *(latest public released version)*, on a **Google Nexus 7** tablet and on a **Google Nexus 5** phone. Both Android devices are running `Android "Lollipop" 5.1`. The plugin is compatible with browsers that natively support, or not, the HTML5 `data-` attribute.

Official support on Chrome 24+, Firefox 20+, Safari 5+, IE 9+ and Opera 11+. Many other browsers may work, but are not extensively tested.


Dependencies
------------
To ensure a stable running of Formalist, you need to have **some requirements** setted on your website.

1. Javascript library `jQuery 1.9` minimum required, tested on 1.9+ and working fine with 2.0+
3. HTML5 doctype, not required, but better for a good W3C validation

Note that jQuery 2.0 or higher doesn't support IE 6/7/8 anymore.
